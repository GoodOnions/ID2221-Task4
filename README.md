# ID2221-Task4 Data Intensive Computing Project
 In this project, we aimed to create a web application capable of providing analytics and statistics on music streaming via Spotify. The project is composed of a back-end and a front-end element that allows users to link their Spotify account and view their listening statistics. The back-end consists of a distributed system designed to process and store all the relevant information.
